Sender and receiver know the same secret key in symmetric systems. Therefore, the same secret key is 
used for both encryption and decryption.

-> sender chooses a secret key to encrypt a plain text, and the recipent uses the same key to decrypt the cipher text.

Encryption and decryption keys are different in public key systems. The encryption key is known by everyone including the sender, 
but the decryption key is only known by the receiver.

-> Receiver first creates its own public and private keys, where the former is open to everyone but the latter is hidden.
Sender uses the former (public key created by the receiver, which is open to everyone) to encrypt a plain text. 
Recipent can decrypt and open the cyphertext encrypted using the public key by sender, with its private key.

If N people want to communicate with each of N-1 other people using symmetric key encryption, each pair of users must have a
shared symmetric key, that is N * (N-1) / 2 keys.

-> N people want to communicate with N-1 other people, and symmetric key encryption uses the same secret key for both encryption
and decrypiton, so N * N -1. Since we only need the same key for one pair, remove duplicates by diving it by 2.

With a public key system (also known as assymetric crypto)

-> Everyone user should have two keys, including one public key which is open to 
everyone and the other which is onlu known by the user. Anyone can use the user's public key to encrypt a plain text, and 
the user can use its own private key to decrypt the cyphertext.

Therefore, every user would need 2 keys for encryption and decryption.
So 2N keys required.

AES is an symmetric cryptography algo'. 
-> The same secret key is used for encryption and decryption. 
Key to sign is the same as the key to verify

AES is less suitable for digital signatures than RSA (public key systems).
-> It is less suitable because digital signatures should only be forged or created by one user, but
in symmetric system, it uses the same secret key, and thus can be used for both verification and creation of signatures.

Asymmetric key crypto is not used to encrypt actual messages.
-> Because it is slower than symmetric. Not suitable for encrypting large amounts of data. Can
only encrypt data up to the sie of the key. As it needs to first encrypt using the public key(which is open to everyone 
and private key to decrypt, where as with symmetric can just use a single key for both, which simplifies
the entire system)

Asymmetric key crypto (public key system. Different keys for encryption and decryption) is 
usually used with symmetric key crypto to encrypt messages.
-> it is used to exchanging a joint secret key for symmetric system.

The entire process would look like
Alice generates her key pair and posts her public key online.
Bob generates a secret key and encrypts his secret key using Alice's public key (public key is always
used to encrypt in public key system)
Bob sends the encrypted text to Alice
Alice uses her own private key to decrypt Bob's encrypted secret key.
Now Alice and Bob share the secret key. This means that secret key is shared in an encrypted way,
and the key can be used as the key for both encryption and decryption of messages between alice and bob.

Degital Ceritifcate is the fundamental job of a certificate in order to bind a public key to 
the name of someone (individual or company). 
It includes details about the owner, information about the public
key, and the signature of the certifying authority.

-> It is a set of information including the public key, owner, and the digital signature.

Suppose certifier.com creates a certificate for foo.com. The entire certificate would be encrypted with 
certifier.com's public key. 

-> False. Ceritifcates need to be distinct so needs to include some data of foo.com, which could be 
a hash of foo.com's information (including its public key), and signed with certifier.com's private key.
As public key is always open to everyone. Needs to sign with private key to certify.
