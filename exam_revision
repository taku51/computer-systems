Sender and receiver know the same secret key in symmetric systems. Therefore, the same secret key is 
used for both encryption and decryption.

-> sender chooses a secret key to encrypt a plain text, and the recipent uses the same key to decrypt the cipher text.

Encryption and decryption keys are different in public key systems. The encryption key is known by everyone including the sender, 
but the decryption key is only known by the receiver.

-> Receiver first creates its own public and private keys, where the former is open to everyone but the latter is hidden.
Sender uses the former (public key created by the receiver, which is open to everyone) to encrypt a plain text. 
Recipent can decrypt and open the cyphertext encrypted using the public key by sender, with its private key.

If N people want to communicate with each of N-1 other people using symmetric key encryption, each pair of users must have a
shared symmetric key, that is N * (N-1) / 2 keys.

-> N people want to communicate with N-1 other people, and symmetric key encryption uses the same secret key for both encryption
and decrypiton, so N * N -1. Since we only need the same key for one pair, remove duplicates by diving it by 2.

With a public key system,
