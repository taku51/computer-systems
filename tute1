1, List two advantages and two disadvantages of having international standards for network protocols.

Advantages:
1. Many computers from all the world can connect together, because they are using the same standard.
2. Easier maintenance and installation because you get used over time and practice.

Disadvantages:
1. If problems occur, they’ll be problems on a global scale.
2. Prevent companies and organisations from developing new technologies


2. Suppose the algorithms used to implement the operations at layer k are changed. Do the implementations of the operations at layers k − 1 and k + 1 need to change accordingly?

This has no impact on the operations at layers k-1 or k+1, because the way it implements the operations changes but the operations themselves remain the same.

3. Suppose there is a change in the service (set of operations) provided by layer k. How does this impact services at layers k − 1 and k + 1?

There is no impact at layer k-1, as it’s already implemented and they don’t change.  But operations in k+1 have to be reimplemented.

4. Suppose that an application generate a message of length M bytes and there are n lower layers each of which adds a h-byte header. What fraction of the network bandwidth is filled with headers?

*Bandwidth -> maximum data transfer rate of a network.  E.g. 1000Mbps (125 megabytes per second)

N layers protocol hierarchy and h bytes of data are added at each layer.
The total number of header bytes is n * h; therefore the space used on headers is n * h.

Message bytes is M.

So the total size is M + nh.

Divide the total number of header bytes by total size to calculate the fraction of bandwidth filled with headers.

(n * h) / (M + (n*h))
