1, List two advantages and two disadvantages of having international standards for network protocols.

Advantages:
1. Many computers from all the world can connect together, because they are using the same standard.
2. Easier maintenance and installation because you get used over time and practice.

Disadvantages:
1. If problems occur, they’ll be problems on a global scale.
2. Prevent companies and organisations from developing new technologies


2. Suppose the algorithms used to implement the operations at layer k are changed. Do the implementations of the operations at layers k − 1 and k + 1 need to change accordingly?

This has no impact on the operations at layers k-1 or k+1.  Using layered protocols leads to breaking up the design problem into smaller, more manageable pieces, 
and layering means that protocols can be changed without affecting higher or lower ones. One possible disadvantage is the performance of a layered system is likely to be worse than the performance of a monolithic system, 
although it is extremely difficult to implement and manage a monolithic system.
