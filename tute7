1. Do routers have IP addresses? If so, how many?
Yes.
Depends on the number of network interface devices

2. Two hosts have IP addresses 192.200.20.5 and 192.200.100.5.

(a) If each is on a /24 network, are they on the same network?
24 bits.  3 decimals are used to represent 8.
Read 24 bits from the left.
false

(b) If each is on a /20 network, are they on the same network?
false

(c) If each is on a /17 network, are they on the same network?
true

(d) if each is on a /14 network, are they on the same network?
true


3. Datagram networks route each packet as a separate unit, independent of
all others. Virtual-circuit networks do not have to do this, since each
data packet follows a predetermined route. Does this observation mean
that virtual-circuit networks do not need the capability to route isolated
packets from an arbitrary source to an arbitrary destination? Explain
your answer.

Yes. Do not figure out the route because it's predetermined.

4. A network on the Internet has a subnet mask of 255.255.240.0. What is
the maximum number of hosts it can handle?

Use Host ID to calculate this.
NET ID for 20, leave 12 bit for Host ID (IP address is 32 bits (4 sets of 3 decimals)). 
12 bits allows 4096 - 2 hosts, 
namely the maximum number of hosts that can be handled are 4094.

5. A router has just received routes to the following new IP networks: 57.6.96.0/21,
57.6.104.0/21, 57.6.112.0/21, and 57.6.120.0/21. If all of them are routed
on the same outgoing line, can they be aggregated? If so, to what? If not,
why not?

A Subnet mask is a 32-bit number that masks an IP address, 
and divides the IP address into network address and host address.

Prefix: substring

57.6.96.0/21
57.6.104.0/21
57.6.112.0/21
57.6.120.0/21

convert the different decimals into bits and take the most optimal one

96: 01100000
104: 01101000
112: 01110000
120: 01111000

They can be aggregated to 57.6.96.0/19.
/19 is the longest prefix that can be taken.

6. A large number of consecutive IP addresses are available starting at 198.16.0.0.
Suppose that four organizations, A, B, C, and D, request 4000, 2000, 4000,
and 8000 addresses, respectively, and in that order, and that each is allocated the lowest available IP addresses. For each of these, give the first
IP address assigned, the last IP address assigned, and the mask in the
w.x.y.z/s notation.

To start with, all the requests are rounded up to a power of two. The starting address, ending
address, and mask are as follows:
4000 addresses require 12 bits. Therefore A: 198.16.0.0 – 198.16.15.255 written as
198.16.0.0/20
2000 addresses require 11 bits. Therefore B: 198.16.16.0 – 198.16.23.255 written as
198.16.16.0/21
4000 addresses require 12 bits. Therefore C: 198.16.32.0 – 198.16.47.255 written as
198.16.32.0/20
8000 addresses require 13 bits. Therefore D: 198.16.64.0 – 198.16.95.255 written as
198.16.64.0/19

7. A router has the following (CIDR) entries in its routing table:
Address/mask Next hop
135.46.56.0/22 Interface 0
135.46.60.0/22 Interface 1
192.53.40.0/23 Router 1
default Router 2
For each of the following IP addresses, what does the router do if a packet
with that address arrives?
(a) 135.46.63.10
(b) 135.46.57.14
(c) 135.46.52.2
(d) 192.53.40.7
(e) 192.53.56.7


8. List one motivation for a host to send an IP packet with the wrong source
IP address. List two ways that this can adversely affect the legitimate
owner of that IP address.
(Note that there are some niche legitimate reasons to spoof addresses:

9. Consider a network with the following link costs. Find the shortest path
from A to B using Dijkstra’s algorithm.
\ A B C D E
A 0 – 1 2 4
B – 0 – 10 4
C 1 – 0 3 2
D 2 10 3 0 5
E 4 4 2 5 0


10. The IP packet header includes a time-to-live field that is decremented by
each router along the path. Why is the time-to-live field necessary?

11. Suppose an ISP owns the block of addresses of the form 101.101.128.0/17.
Suppose it wants to create four subnets from this block, each block having
the same number of IP addresses. What are the prefixes (of form a.b.c.d/x)
for the four subnets?


12. Consider the example of BGP shown in the lectures (also given below)
(a) What is an Autonomous Sytem? What do A, B and C represent?


(b) As shown in the figure, a physical path exists between AS2 and AS3,
as well as between AS3 and AS4. Can a packet sent from C with
destination A be sent from AS4 to AS3 to AS2? Why or why not?


13. Bonus for fun: IPv6 uses 16-byte addresses. If a block of 1 million addresses is allocated every picosecond, how long will the addresses last?
The following questions are brain teasers. If you have questions, please ask on
the forum. These should not take tutorial time away from the above questions.


14. Challenge question: Imagine that 192.168.4.0/24 has been into four /26
subnets. You want to allocate a new /25 in that same /24. Somebody
points out that each existing subnet only uses the first half of its allocation, and suggests that each could be turned into a /7 with basically no
reconfiguration. Would this work? If so, how? If not, how could you make
room for the /25 with minimal reconfiguration?


15. Challenge question: When Dijkstra’s algorithm “closes” a node, how can
we know that it has found the shortest pah to that node? (That is, give
a heuristic proof of correctness for Dijkstra’s algorithm.)
