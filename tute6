1. What is the difference between a symmetric-key cryptography system and a public-key system?


2. Suppose N people want to communicate with each of N − 1 other people using symmetric
key encryption. All communication between any two people, i and j, is visible to all other
people in this group of N, and no other person in this group should be able to decode their
communication. How many keys are required in the system as a whole? Now suppose that
public key encryption is used. How many keys are required in this case?


3. Is AES an asymmetric or symmetric cryptography algorithm? What does that mean? Why
is AES less suitable for digital signatures than RSA?


4. Why is asymmetric key cryptography not often used to encrypt actual messages? Describe
how asymmetric key cryptography is commonly used in combination with symmetric key
cryptography to encrypt messages.



5. What is a digital certificate?


6. Suppose certifier.com creates a certificate for foo.com. Typically, the entire certificate would
be encrypted with certifier.com’s public key. True or False?


7. The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is being used to establish a secret key between Alice and
Bob. Alice sends Bob (p = 227, g = 5, TA = g
x = 82). Bob responds with (125). Alice’s
secret number, x, is 12, and Bob’s secret number, y, is 3. Show how Alice and Bob compute
the secret key.



8. RSA asymmetric cryptography uses powers of large numbers modulo a third number, like
Diffie-Hellman key exchange. It relies on the fact that there are triples of numbers (d, e, n)
such that for any integer m, (me) d ≡ m(mod n). The public key consists of e and n, and the
private key consists of d and n. Encryption consists of calculating me
(mod n). Decrypting ciphertext c consists of calculating c d (mod n).
Explain in one or two lines why this will always decrypt to the correct plaintext.
Encrypt the message 6 with the key (e = 3, n = 55). Decrypt the ciphertext with the key
(d = 7, n = 55).


9. Alice wants to communicate with Bob, using public-key cryptography. She establishes a
connection to someone she hopes is Bob. She asks him for his public key and he sends it to
her in plaintext along with an X.509 certificate signed by the root CA. Alice already has the
public key of the root CA. What steps does Alice carry out to verify that she is talking to
Bob? Assume that Bob does not care who he is talking to (e.g., Bob is some kind of public
service).
This will require more detail than was given in the lectures. A long answer is given at
question 2 of https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/139176/details-of-tls-certificateverification


10. Suppose that a system uses PKI based on a tree-structured hierarchy of CAs. Alice wants
to communicate with Bob, and receives a certificate from Bob signed by a CA X after
establishing a communication channel with Bob. Suppose Alice has never heard of X. What
steps does Alice take to verify that she is talking to Bob?

11. (Brainstorming question; there are no right or wrong answers). In what ways could a salt be
combined with a plaintext before encryption? What are the pros and cons of each method?



12. Describe the TLS Handshake process.


13. Challenge question: It is a fact that if x ≡ X(mod p) and y ≡ Y (mod p) then xy ≡
XY (mod p) — that is, we can reduce factors before we perform the multiplication. Use this
fact to show how to calculate g a (mod p) efficiently for large a and large p. (Hint: express a in binary, and use the laws governing exponentials.)


14. Challenge question: Recall that x ≡ X(mod p) means that x − X − np for some integer n.
Use that to prove the first sentence in the previous question.


15. Challenge question: Both Electronic Codebook and Cipher Block Chaining modes from AES
can, in principle, be used with asymmetric coding instead of AES. Can Cipher Feedback,
shown in Figure 1, be used with asymmetric coding? If so, how? If not, why not? Further,
the final plaintext is not passed through a cipher block; does that mean it is less well protected
than with ECB and CBC, or the earlier plaintext blocks with CFB?
