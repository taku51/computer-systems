What's transport layer security?
Security socket layer ssl
Basis of HTTPS
Encrypts transmission to prevent eavesdropping () and
modification
Help the server identify who it seems to be

What's secure communication?
– private communication between two end-points, with
– integrity checks to ensure data does not change in transit, and
– authentication to establish identities of one or both of the end

How's TLS handshake done?
A: Client Hello: Cipher suites
B: Server Hello: cipher suites, client certificate
A: Send key
B: Send key
= Encrypted data exchange

1, Client sends Client hello for secure connection,
listing its supported “cipher suites”

2, Server responds with ServerHello and selects one of the cipher
suites presented, includes its certificate, and
request the client send its certificate (mutual authentication)

3, Client confirms validity of certificate

4, Client generates session key

5, once these steps are done and both parties share a key that is then
used for encrypting/decrypting messages.

what's TLS Crypto?
Sec Nodes
Encryption
– Hiding data from everyone except those holding the decryption key
– Output is a cipher text

Decryption
– Recovering the original data from the cipher text using the key
– Output is a plaintext

Basis: intended receiver knows a secret “key” that is
unknown to eavesdroppers

what's crypto?
based on maths. well studied and believed computationally hard
  Factorising the product of 2 large primes (RSA)
  Solving discrete logs (ElGamal)
  AES - substitution-permutation network
  
No perfect sec
  always susceptible to brute force
  but make it hard to compute within the lifetime of the data

what's symmetric crypto?
Encrypt(SecretKey, Message) -> Cipher Text
Decrypt(SecretKey, Cipher Text) -> Message

– Same key is used for encryption and decryption
to share a message with someone, find some way of securely exchanging the secret key

- Useful for keeping own data secure
full disk encryption

E.g. AES

What's AES?
AES breaks data into blocks and encrypts each block
AES has different modes of operation
– ECB, CBC, CTR, etc.
– Determines how each block is treated, and/or linked

what's assymetric crypto?
– Two keys, encrypt with one, decrypt with the other
– One of the most important developments in modern computer
science

Sender can only encrypt to make duplicates
