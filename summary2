What's transport layer security?
Security socket layer ssl
Basis of HTTPS
Encrypts transmission to prevent eavesdropping () and
modification
Help the server identify who it seems to be

What's secure communication?
– private communication between two end-points, with
– integrity checks to ensure data does not change in transit, and
– authentication to establish identities of one or both of the end

How's TLS handshake done?
A: Client Hello: Cipher suites
B: Server Hello: cipher suites, client certificate
A: Send key
B: Send key
= Encrypted data exchange

1, Client sends Client hello for secure connection,
listing its supported “cipher suites”

2, Server responds with ServerHello and selects one of the cipher
suites presented, includes its certificate, and
request the client send its certificate (mutual authentication)

3, Client confirms validity of certificate

4, Client generates session key

5, once these steps are done and both parties share a key that is then
used for encrypting/decrypting messages.

what's TLS Crypto?
Sec Nodes
Encryption
– Hiding data from everyone except those holding the decryption key
– Output is a cipher text

Decryption
– Recovering the original data from the cipher text using the key
– Output is a plaintext

Basis: intended receiver knows a secret “key” that is
unknown to eavesdroppers

what's crypto?
based on maths. well studied and believed computationally hard
  Factorising the product of 2 large primes (RSA)
  Solving discrete logs (ElGamal)
  AES - substitution-permutation network
  
No perfect sec
  always susceptible to brute force
  but make it hard to compute within the lifetime of the data

what's symmetric crypto?
Encrypt(SecretKey, Message) -> Cipher Text
Decrypt(SecretKey, Cipher Text) -> Message

– Same key is used for encryption and decryption
to share a message with someone, find some way of securely exchanging the secret key

- Useful for keeping own data secure
full disk encryption

E.g. AES

What's AES?
1, breaks data into blocks
2, encrypts each block

AES has different modes of operation
– ECB, CBC, CTR, etc.
– Determines how each block is treated, and/or linked
Can be generated from a password.
256 bit key derived from supplied password
Random salt stored 

what's assymetric crypto?
– Two keys, encrypt with one, decrypt with the other
– One of the most important developments in modern computer
science

Sender can only encrypt to make duplicates

what's electronic codebook?
Symmetric encryption, which replaces each block of the clear text by the block of ciphertext. 

Simple, parallelisable
maybe no diffusion and confidentiality
should never be used

How electroniccodebook is done?
1, split the clear text into blocks of N bits
2, encrypt (decrypt) each block of clear text using the only key.

what's cipher block chaining?
Initialisation vector -> not secret
must be random and not reused, done sequentially
Decryption can be done parallely
Loss of a block or corrupt IV prevents decription of all subsequent blocks.

How is cipher block chaining done?
1, data is encrypted in specific blocks
2, each block is dependent on the blocks before it for decryption. 
The process uses an initialization vector to help tie these blocks of encrypted data together

what's the goal of Internet (network layer)?
get data from the source all the way to the destination
Point to point link (maybe not in a single hop)

What's the link?
Entire network

What's important for Internet (network layer)?
Traffic must be routed efficiently (by routers)
Nodes must have (addresses)

What's internet?
network of networks

what's connectionless network?
Packet Switching (datagram network)
MInimum require service.
here's packet, here's packet...

what's connection-oriented?
Circuit switching

What are the type, addressing, state, routing, quality of service, congestion control of connectionless   net work?
Type: connectionless, datagram
Addressing: each packet has full source and destination
State: Routers need not hold state info about connections
Routing: each packet independently
Quality of service: difficult
Congestion control: difficult

What are the type, addressing, state, routing, quality of service, congestion control of connection-oriented?
Type: connection oriented, circuit
Addressing: each packet contains a short VC number
State: Each VC requires router table space per connection
Routing: Defined at setup (circuit so it's predefined)
Quality of service: easy if enough resources
Congestion control: easy if enough resources

What's quality of service?
not all services are equally important.
e.g. not all services are equally impo or robust to network delay
  VoIP vs file downloads
  VPN connections vs web browsing.

what's packet switching?
Internet is a packet switched network
e.g. host A sends a packet to host B
1, Host A Transmits it to the nerest router (A)
2, The packet is buffered while it is arriving.
3, If valid, the packet is stored until the outgoing interface is free
4, Router forwards the packet onto the next router in the path
5, Repeat 2-4
called store and forward network

what's multiprotocol label switching?
Example of connection oriented
Primary purpose is quality of service:
- Priortising traffic
- service level agreements for network perfo
- Reliable connectivity with known parameters

Popular with businesses that want to connect multiple sites and phone companies carrying voice traffic
Internet connection is cheaper than telecom connection

what are the numbers of IPv4 Addresses?
[000.000.000, 255.255.255.255]

what are the types of addresses?
Unicast: one dest (normal)
broadcast: send to everyone
multicast: sent to a partciular set of nodes (video streaming)
anycast: send to any one of a set of addresses (database queries)
geocast: send to all users in a geographic area (send ad to those in store, warning to those near a hazard)

what are the classes?
Determine how IP addresses were allocated.
They simplify routing -> size of network field
Networks often bigger than needed

what's IPv6?
designed 20 years ago to improve the problem of exhausting IPv4 address space
Made simpler header -> faster processing
improved security
further quality of service support

IPv6 addresses are 128 bits -> unlikely ever run out, unless new wasterful allocation schemes are used.
-> still not widely deployed.

what happens if IPv4 are not needed anymore?
If companies go bankrupt, they would sell IPv4 at premium.

what's Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange?
Generates private key.
Each entity generates random parts of in KEY
One exchanges partial KEY  publicly to the other
On receiving partial KEY, each entity adds its partial KEY with the received one
Finally: each entity has the same key for en cryption

What are the features of DHKE?
KEY never exposed to public - generated same key on both ends
Only partial KEYs: useless to eavesdroppers
Randomly/newly generated key: not applicable to previous cipher text
uses g^ab mod p (Alice provides a, Bob provides b)

If g = 4, p = 23
Alice chooses a = 5, Bob chooses b = 13
Alice computes 4^5 mod 23 = 12 and sends it to Bob
Bob computes 4^13 mode 23 = 16 and sends it to Alice
Alice computes 16^5 mod 23 = 6
Bob computes 12^13 mod 23 = 6
P needs to be a large prime number

What's Public key infra?
Assymetric key exchange.
Alice posts her public key onliune
Bob generates a secret key
Bob runs encrypt using the public key online and his secret key and create cipher text
Bob sends the cipher text to alice
Alice runs decrtot using privatekey and cipher text to generate the secret key
Now Alice and Bob share a secret key and can exchange symmetrically encrypted messages.
-> How TLS (HTTPS) works.

*Alice's public key is associated with her private key. and using that private key to decrypt someone's cipher text
which was encrypted using her public key.

what's cipher text?
encrypted text

Why asymmetric?
No need to perform key exchange between entities
  * sender don't need to touch priv key

what's public key signature?
validity of a priv key holder
Priv key holder: encrypting a message M with its priv key signature
Verification:
  Anyone else with pub KEY decrypts signature received M.recv if M.recv equal to M verified.
  Non repudiation.
Unlike the other ones, it uses public key to encrypt and private key to decrypt.
Only the person who has the private key can sign it (decrypt it).

What's good about PKI?
Infeasible to reverse, easy and fast to calculate.

What's Cryptgraphic hashing?
Quick to compute, hard to invert
Encryption with no decryption key
e.g. used for password matching, just one way unless brute forcing.
checking passwords on the web.
Protect confidentiality

 M is too large?
 Hashing M

what's cipher suite?
Encryption algo.
Diff combo of encryption the system uses

what's packet forwarding?
the basic method for sharing information across systems on a network. 
Packets are transferred between a source interface and a destination interface, usually on two different systems. 
When you issue a command or send a message to a nonlocal interface, your system forwards those packets onto the local network. 
The interface with the destination IP address that is specified in the packet headers then retrieves 
the packets from the local network. If the destination address is not on the local network, 
the packets are then forwarded to the next adjacent network, or hop.

what's routing table?
used to give instructions of how to forward packets
CIDR
But overflow problems sometimes -> but lookup and exchange

what do the routing tables have?
Destination IP (base) : input
Subnet Mask : input
Outgoing Line (physical or virtual) : output

e.g: 203.32.8.0 (destination address) 255.255.255.0 (subnet mask) Eth 0 (outgoing)
Longest mask always used when choosing a route

what's classlessinterdomainrouting(CIDR)?
is a way to allow more flexible allocation of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses 
than was possible with the original system of IP address classes. As a result, 
the number of available Internet addresses was greatly increased, which along 
with widespread use of network address translation (NAT), has significantly 
extended the useful life of IPv4.
