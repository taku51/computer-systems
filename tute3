1. How many connections does FTP use when a file needs to be transfered
between the client and the server? What are these connections? What
are they used for? What are the connection types of them?



2. Describe the commonalities and differences between STMP and (persistent) HTTP.


3. Suppose that John just set up an auto-forwarding mechanism on his work
email address, which receives all of his business-related emails, to forward
them to his personal email address, which he shares with his wife. John’s
wife was unaware of this, and activated a vacation agent on their personal
account. Because John forwarded his email, he did not set up a vacation
daemon on his work machine. What happens when an email is received
at John’s work email address?


4. Consider a situation in which a cyberterrorist makes all the DNS servers
in the world crash simultaneously. How does this change one’s ability to
use the Internet?


5. Is it possible for an organization’s Web server and mail server to have
exactly the same alias for a hostname (for example, foo.com)? How does
a DNS server distinguish these two types of mapping, namely, hostnameweb server IP and hostname-mail server IP?



6. DNS uses UDP instead of TCP. If a DNS packet is lost, there is no automatic recovery. Does this cause a problem, and if so, how is it solved?






7. Suppose you can access the caches in the local DNS servers of your department. Can you propose a way to roughly determine the Web servers
(outside your department) that are most popular among the users in your
department? Explain.
