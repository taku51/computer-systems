1. How many connections does FTP use when a file needs to be transfered
between the client and the server? What are these connections? What
are they used for? What are the connection types of them?

2 connections.
One is control connection (persistent -> should be open during the entire connection), which is used to control information between the two hosts (client and server), such
-> authenticate user info, password, sending commands, receive responses.

The other is data connection (non-persistent -> only when transferring files), which is used to send files.

2. Describe the commonalities and differences between STMP and (persistent) HTTP.

The commonalities are file transfer and persistent connection (all the common protocols these days).
Both protocols are used to transfer files from one host to another.  HTTP is for web file transfer; STMP is for email
messages.

They both belong to the application layer.

The differences are pull vs push, and message encoding.
SMTP is a push protocol.  The sending mail server pushes the file to the receiving mail server.
HTTP is a pull protocol.  Users use HTTP to pull information from the server at their convenience.

SMTP also requires each message to be in 7-bit ASCII format.

Another difference is how they hundle multiple documents.  SMTP places all of the message's objects into a message, but
HTTP encapusulates each object in its own HTTP response message.

SMTP : port num 25
HTTP : port num 80

3. Suppose that John just set up an auto-forwarding mechanism on his work
email address, which receives all of his business-related emails, to forward
them to his personal email address, which he shares with his wife. John’s
wife was unaware of this, and activated a vacation agent on their personal
account. Because John forwarded his email, he did not set up a vacation
daemon on his work machine. What happens when an email is received
at John’s work email address?

Will send back the vacation email to John's work email address.

4. Consider a situation in which a cyberterrorist makes all the DNS servers
in the world crash simultaneously. How does this change one’s ability to
use the Internet?

DNS servers start stemming from their roots, so it depends on which servers in the hierarchy to get crashed.

5. Is it possible for an organization’s Web server and mail server to have
exactly the same alias for a hostname (for example, foo.com)? How does
a DNS server distinguish these two types of mapping, namely, hostnameweb server IP and hostname-mail server IP?



6. DNS uses UDP instead of TCP. If a DNS packet is lost, there is no automatic recovery. Does this cause a problem, and if so, how is it solved?
