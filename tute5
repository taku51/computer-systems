RDT 3.0 Timer : Stop and Wait protocol. Can't process multiple segments.

TCP fast retransmission: not strictly required.

Flow control:
Prevent the sender from overflowing the receiver's buffer
  - Receiver's buffer is full, but there are still new pkts arriving
  - controls over;
  
Rwnd -> receive window: spare space in receiver's buffer
  The capability of how much btes the receiver could receive at this point.
  Rwnd -> spare space = total buffer size - buffer still occupied
  Buffer stil occupied = bytes received - bytes read/processed (once read them can remove).
  
TCP - segment loss
  Sender performs retransmission when
    timer time out
    receive 4 packets with the same ACK.
    
Potential deadlock:
  while sender flushes all receiver's buffer
    rwnd = 0, sender must stop sending and wait for spare buffer space available on receiver
    receiver clears the buffer and wait for sender to send new pkt
    
  Both in passive state: waiting for the opposites
  
  Solutions:
    active sender: on receiving rwnd = 0, constant pings zero window.
    
TCP congestion control
Target: negotiating on data transfer rate between sender & receiver when congested

How? -> set a initial threshold
        test the threshold
            if not suitable
              change it (slower)
            if suitable
              keep it

ssthreshold - slow start threshold

(slow start) cwnd == ssthreshold -> cwnd += 1 (congestion avoidance) 4 same ACK, ssthreshold = cwnd/2,
cwnd = ssthreshold + 3 <-> New ACK (fast recov) <-> 4 same ACK, timeout(slow start)


1. What is the difference between congestion control and flow control? What
methods (as discussed in the lectures) are used in TCP to provide each
functionality?



2. How can a deadlock occur in the TCP Sliding Window protocol? What
is the countermeasure used in TCP to prevent this scenario happening?


3. How does the TCP Slow Start algorithm detect potential congestion in
the network? What other methods (possibly with the explicit assistance
of the network layer) could be used to infer congestion in the network?


4. Suppose that the network is not congested. How does the congestion
window size cwnd get increase in each transmission round in the Slow
Start, Congestion Avoidance and Fast Recovery algorithms, respectively?


5. When will the congestion control enter into the Congestion Avoidance
algorithm from the Slow Start algorithm?


6. How does the Slow Start algorithm handle segment loss events?


7. How does the Congestion Avoidance algorithm handle segment loss events?



8. For the fast retransmission event, why does it set cwnd = ssthresh + 3 Â·
MSS rather than cwnd = ssthresh?
