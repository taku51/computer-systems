End Systems:

Mobile phones, Computers... -> routers -> modems -> Internet Service Providers (Telstra, TPG, Optus)

Modems uses degital subscriber line (ADSL), cable (Television Company), fiber (fastest), dial-up, satellite

Packet switches (routers, link-layer switches)

Packets = info sent through the communication links.

Control the sending and receiving of packets by running protocols (rules)

LAN = local area network -> managed by users (can make its own protocols, connect raptops with cables)
WAN = wide area network -> generally managed by companies (connecting between tokyo office and london office)
