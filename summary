A nuts and bolts description:

The Internet is a computer network that interconnects computing devices.

End Systems:

Mobile phones, Computers... -> routers -> modems -> Internet Service Providers (Telstra, TPG, Optus)

Modems uses degital subscriber line (ADSL), cable (Television Company), fiber (fastest), dial-up, satellite

Packet switches (routers, link-layer switches)

Packets = info sent through the communication links.

Control the sending and receiving of packets by running protocols (rules)

LAN = local area network -> managed by users (can make its own protocols, connect raptops with cables)
WAN = wide area network -> generally managed by companies (connecting between tokyo office and london office)

Protocols:
1, the format of messages
2, orders of the messages to be communicated
3, actions taken on the tramsmission of a message

Request -> reply -> Request -> reply

All activity in the Internet that involves two or more communicating remote entities is governed by a protocol.

Internet protocols are TCP/IP

Intranet = internal networks within companies

Advantage of using protocols -> structural abstraction of the entire process (decoupling by implementing layers)

Disadvantage -> could be delay between layers, errors, overheads


Open Systems Interconnection -> is not used these days but good to learn
OSI (7 layers):
Application -> users provide network services (make emails written by users network processable by lower layers)

Presentation -> format information into the same form so that every device on the network can see the same messsages.

Session -> manages connections between applications (mail application <-> mail server)

Transport -> controls flow, order (split data to send), response check, re-send, window (size of data to be sent) -> to make sure data are sent properly

Network -> rooting (find the path), send data to the selected path (IP Address -> tells wherein the network the computer is located), data structures, identify the initial address & final address  -> enables communications between different networks

DataLink -> when to send data, detect errors and fix them, data structures, identify the initial address & final address  -> enables communications between different networks
enable communications between closely connected (in the same local network area) network devices using MAC address (Organizationally unique identifier)
-> can find which maker made the device with the OUI code.

Physical

TCP/IP Model (4 layers):

Application -> http, pop, smtp, ftp, telnet, ssh

Transport -> TCP, UDP

Internet -> IP, ICMP, ARP

Network Interface -> Not defined
