A nuts and bolts description:

The Internet is a computer network that interconnects computing devices.

End Systems:

Mobile phones, Computers... -> routers -> modems -> Internet Service Providers (Telstra, TPG, Optus)

Modems uses degital subscriber line (ADSL), cable (Television Company), fiber (fastest), dial-up, satellite

Packet switches (routers, link-layer switches)

Packets = info sent through the communication links.

Control the sending and receiving of packets by running protocols (rules)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LAN = local area network -> managed by users (can make its own protocols, connect raptops with cables)
WAN = wide area network -> generally managed by companies (connecting between tokyo office and london office)

Protocols:
1, the format of messages
2, orders of the messages to be communicated
3, actions taken on the tramsmission of a message

Request -> reply -> Request -> reply

All activity in the Internet that involves two or more communicating remote entities is governed by a protocol.

Internet protocols are TCP/IP

Intranet = internal networks within companies

Advantage of using protocols -> structural abstraction of the entire process (decoupling by implementing layers)

Disadvantage -> could be delay between layers, errors, overheads

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open Systems Interconnection -> is not used these days but good to learn
OSI (7 layers):
Application -> users provide network services (make emails written by users network processable by lower layers)

Presentation -> format information into the same form so that every device on the network can see the same messsages.

Session -> manages connections between applications (mail application <-> mail server) -> checkpointing, recovery

Transport -> controls flow, order (split data to send), response check, re-send, window (size of data to be sent) -> to make sure data are sent properly

Network -> rooting (find the path), send data to the selected path (IP Address -> tells wherein the network the computer is located, uni cast add -> 1 to 1, broadcast add -> 1 to many
one to many, multicast add -> one to a large number), data structures, identify the initial address & final address  -> enables communications between different networks

(Global IP for the Internet, Private IP for private network)

DataLink -> when to send data, detect errors and fix them, data structures, identify the initial address & final address  -> enables communications between different networks
-> enable communications between closely connected (in the same local network area) network devices using MAC address (Organizationally unique identifier)
-> can find which maker made the device with the OUI code.

Physical -> convert bit numbers into signals, and vice versa (connector shapes, pin allocations, cable types, voltage level,
voltage alternator, transmission speed, encoding scheme)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each layer uses the "header" to identify which data belong to them.
Adding the "header" to the data sent from the previous layer is called encapsulating, and taking the header off at the current
layer is called decapsulating.

Protocol Data Unit

As the header is added when moving to the lower layer, data are called differently in each layer.

Datalink -> frame
Network -> Packet
Transport -> Segment

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------



TCP/IP Model (5 layers):

Application -> http (web surfing), pop, smtp (email), ftp (file transfer bet' end systems), telnet, ssh
-> Help exchange packets of information with the application in another end system. Packets are called messages in this layer.

Transport -> TCP (connection oriented service, reliable) -> phone call, UDP (conncetionless service, unrealiable -> not sure where they'll be delivered) -> post office
-> Transports application layer messages between application endpoints.

Network -> IP (The fields in the packet, and how the end systems and routers act on these fields) ->all internet components that have this layer must run this protocol. 
, ICMP, ARP -> (Responsible for moving network layer packet from one end system to another) 

Link -> wifi protocol, ethernet protocol -> delivers the packets called frames to the next node along the route
Move entire frames from one network element to the next element in the route.

Physical -> move the indiviaul bbits within the frames from the network element to the next
-> protocols are link dependent and further depend on the actual trasmission medium of the link.
Ex, Twist-pair opper wire, single mode fiber optics

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TCP & OSI Comparison

Application = Application, Presentation, Session
Transport = Transport
Internet = Network
Network Interface = Data Link, Physical

Presentation layer and Session layer are not important in TCP/IP model

If an application needs these two, developers can implement on their own.

Top down approach so start from application and end with Physical

Socket is an interface between the application and transport, sometimes referred as an API.
